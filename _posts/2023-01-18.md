## Issue 
I wanted to import SCT(Sustainability Control Tower) data into SAC (SAP Analytics Cloud)

## What I've tried 
As SCT is based on PaPM, I tried ways to connect PaPM to SAC.
1. OData Connection (Ytable)
2. HANA table Connection


## Solution
HANA table Connection does not work because I do not have access to the information of the HANA DB of the SCT.

OData Connection did not work as it did in PaPM, but I was able to connect SCT OData API to SAC through OData Connection.


## Lesson Learned
Data from outbound APIs can be imported with OData Services Connection.
Fill in the following items.
Data Service URL : https://<span>xxxxxxxxxx/api/sct-analytics-service/v1/sustainabilityMetrics -> because I am using the API '[SustainabilityMetrics](https://api.sap.com/api/SustainabilityMetrics/overview)'
OAuth Client ID
Secret 
Token URL : add /oauth/token at the end.

Understand how the connection works.
Understand what OData really means.
