## Issue 
I have a jekyll theme blog set up and a blog with 'Chirpy' running on local computer, but when I tried to commit a blog with a theme 'Chirpy' and I end up with build error.

## What I've tried 
I looked up several blogs for beginners, which helped my set up repository on mac and to set up a blog with jekyll theme.
I ended up with a blog with a different theme, but I guessed all the themes are similar as long as they are jekyll themes.


## Solution
I read the official document made by the person who created Chirpy.

## Lesson Learned
Don't overlook the power of official documents.


## Maybe tomorrow
Try to add a picture to a next log.
